note: on newer systems these adaptions may not be necessary!

visualizationSettings.h:
- comment line:
  os << "  initialModelRotation = " << Matrix3DF(initialModelRotation) << "\n";
  ==> does not work as compiler does not get clue for conversion from 3x3 into <float,9> matrix


basicLinalg.h:
- inline auto NumIntegrate ==> inline does not work, put #ifndef __APPLE__

#if you use Apple M1 CPUs or MacOS 11, you may need to replace the glfw lib with newer library

#do following steps to compile:

python setup.py bdist_wheel
==>gives some clang errors, like error: unknown argument '-framework Cocoa', etc.

copy g++ ... output and paste it into terminal window again
==> links again with warnings, but now works and creates the objects

type again:
python setup.py bdist_wheel
==> creates wheel

pip install dist/exudyn-1.0.215- ... .whl
==> installs exudyn

==> go to Examples
python stiffFlyballGovernor2.py

#TRIALS with VirtualBox and MacOS 10.15 Mojave
#install virtual box and MacOS as described in https://www.wikigain.com/install-macos-mojave-on-virtualbox-windows/
#does not run on every computer!
#install Anaconda (used Anaconda3-2021.05 with Python3.8)
#run:
python setup.py bdist_wheel
#may write: gcc requires the command line developer tools: INSTALL, e.g., with command line:
#xcode-select --install
#if this does not work, you need to go to developer.apple.com
#download and install xcode command line tools (Version 11.5 can be installed)
#follow "steps to compile" as written above! 
#for MacOS 10.15 you need to go to -std=c++14 and require only 10.9 as minimum OS version, see the respective lines in setup.py
#==> still, compilation failed due too old compiler!

#for larger screen resolution
#install guest additions (double click on .iso file in VirtualBox installation dir, execute according .exe file)
#follow https://www.nakivo.com/blog/make-virtualbox-full-screen/
#power off virtual machine
#run CMD as Administrator.
#cd "c:\Program Files\oracle\virtualbox"
#VBoxManage setextradata "macOSMojave10-14" VBoxInternal2/EfiGraphicsResolution 1920x1080
#maybe need to restart computer in between
