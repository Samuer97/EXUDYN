For OpenVR to run with Exudyn, it needs to be compiled with (also add --parallel !)
python setup.py --openvr bdist_wheel

==========================================
Windows:
- install steamVR:
https://store.steampowered.com/about

if you have no real equipment, 
- install Riftcat 2 (https://riftcat.com/vridge) for Windows
- install same app for mobile device (tested on Android)
- start Riftcat on Windows and phone, connect via Wifi or USB
- use some cheap phone adapter
- Phone will show the stereo rendered scene

- for HTC vive, install their software and check hardware setup:

==========================================
linux:

tested with Python 3.9 in env
sudo apt install libopenvr-dev
==> installs libopenvr_api.so
run setup.py with --openvr
(adds -lopenvr_api  in setup.py)
