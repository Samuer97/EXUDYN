\mysection{3D graphics visualization}
%
The 3D graphics visualization window is kept simple, but useful to see the animated results of the multibody system.
The graphics output is restricted to a 3D window (renderwindow) into which the renderer draws the visualization state of the \texttt{MainSystem} \texttt{mbs}.

	\hline
  \bf Button & action & \bf remarks \\ \hline
  \bf left mouse button & move model & keep left mouse button pressed to move the model in the current x/y plane\\ \hline

	\bf right mouse button & show item dictionary & [EXPERIMENTAL, must be activated in visualizationSettings.interactive] (short) press and release right mouse button \\ \hline
\hline
  \bf mouse wheel & zoom & use mouse wheel to zoom (on touch screens 'pinch-to-zoom' might work as well) \\ \hline
  \end{longtable}
\end{center}
Note that current mouse coordinates can be obtained via \texttt{SystemContainer.GetCurrentMouseCoordinates()}.
%
\mysubsubsection{6D mouse}
Graphics engines, especially in CAD and finite elements allow input of special 3D or 6D mouse devices.
There is a basic interface for so-called 3D mouse / 6D mouse or space mouse, allowing to map the 6D joystick to translation and rotation,
see \texttt{visualizationSettings.interactive.useJoystickInput} and similar options.
The interface only works, if the device maps 6 coordinates to the joystick input of GLFW (tested with 3DCONNEXION mouse).

\mysubsection{Render state}
\label{sec:renderState}
The system container function \texttt{SC.GetRenderState()} returns a dictionary with current information on the renderer.
This information is updated whenever the renderer performs redrawing or when according changes in the renderer are performed.

When starting with a empty \texttt{mbs} and calling \texttt{exu.StartRenderer()}, the \texttt{SC.GetRenderState()} will return:
\pythonstyle\begin{lstlisting}
{'centerPoint': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
 'maxSceneSize': 1.0,
 'zoom': 0.4000000059604645,
 'currentWindowSize': [1024, 768],
 'displayScaling': 1.0,
 'modelRotation': [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]],
 'mouseCoordinates': [0.0, 0.0],
 'openGLcoordinates': [0.0, 0.0],
 'joystickPosition': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
 'joystickRotation': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
 'joystickAvailable': -1}
\end{lstlisting}

There is a set of variables, which can be actively changed by calling  \texttt{SC.SetRenderState(renderState)} with renderState
containing a modified dictionary:
\bi
  \item \texttt{centerPoint}: this is a 3D vector (list/numpy-array) containing the center point for the current view; modifying this vector allows to track objects in you simulation
  \item \texttt{maxSceneSize}: this value is used in the 3D view, clipping objects nearer or farer than this size; also used for perspective view; computed automatically based on the model
  \item \texttt{zoom}: this factor changes the zoom for the renderer, in fact for the size of the view; this leads to smaller objects with larger zoom values
  \item \texttt{modelRotation}: this is the rotation matrix used for model rotation; changing this matrix allows to rotate the model in the view; overwriting modelRotation, centerPoint and zoom with stored values allows to reset to a certain (default) view
\ei
Note that other items in renderState are ignored. The read only variables in \texttt{SC.GetRenderState()} are:
\bi
  \item \texttt{currentWindowSize}: contains current window size, which is different from default values in visualizationSettings, if window is scaled by user
  \item \texttt{displayScaling}: contains display scaling (monitor scaling; content scaling) as returned by GLFW and Windows (always 1 on Linux); used internally in renderer to scale fonts
  \item \texttt{mouseCoordinates}: returns 2D vector of current mouse coordinates on screen
  \item \texttt{openGLcoordinates}: returns 3D vector of current mouse coordinates
  \item \texttt{joystickAvailable}: set True, if a special 6D mouse is available (only works for special hardware, e.g., 3Dconnexion space mouse)
  \item \texttt{joystickPosition}: contains current joystick position vector information 
  \item \texttt{joystickRotation}: contains current joystick rotation vector information (linearized rotation angles)
\ei

\mysubsection{GraphicsData}
\label{sec:graphicsData}
All graphics objects are defined by a \texttt{GraphicsData} structure.%, see \refSection{sec:graphicsData}.
Note that currently the visualization is based on a very simple and ancient OpenGL implementation, as there is currently no simple platform independent alternative. However, most of the heavy load triangle-based operations are implemented in C++ and are realized by very efficient OpenGL commands. However, note that the number of triangles to represent the object should be kept in a feasible range ($<1000000$) in order to obtain a fast response of the renderer.

Many objects include a \texttt{GraphicsData} dictionary structure for definition of attached visualization of the object.
Note that objects expect a list of \texttt{GraphicsData}, which can be produced with \texttt{GraphicsData...(...)} functions. Note that if reading out the \texttt{GraphicsData} from the object again, it usually has a different structure sorted by types of \texttt{GraphicsData}.
Typically, you can use primitives (cube, sphere, ...) or \ac{STL} data to define the objects appearance.
\texttt{GraphicsData} dictionaries can be created with functions provided in the utilities module \texttt{exudyn.graphicsDataUtilities.py}, see \refSection{sec:module:graphicsDataUtilities}.

\texttt{GraphicsData} can be transformed into points and triangles (mesh) and can be used for contact computation, as well.
\mybold{NOTE} that for correct rendering and correct contact computations, all triangle nodes must follow a strict local order and triangle normals -- if defined -- must point outwards, see \fig{fig:triangleNormals}.
\begin{figure}[tbh]%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\columnwidth]{figures/triangleNormal}%
\end{center}
\caption{Definition of triangle normals and outside/inside regions in Exudyn: the normal to a triangle with vertex positions $\pv_0$, $\pv_1$, $\pv_2$ is computed from cross product as $\nv = \frac{(\pv_1-\pv_0) \times (\pv_2-\pv_0)}{|(\pv_1-\pv_0) \times (\pv_2-\pv_0)|}$;
the normal $\nv$ then points to the outside region of the mesh or body; the direction of $\nv$ just depends on the ordering of the vertex points (interchange of two points changes the normal direction); correct normals are needed for contact computations as well as for correct shading effects in visualization.}%
\label{fig:triangleNormals}%
\end{figure}

\texttt{BodyGraphicsData} contains a list of \texttt{GraphicsData} items, i.e.\ bodyGraphicsData = [graphicsItem1, graphicsItem2, ...]. Every single \texttt{graphicsItem} may be defined as one of the following structures using a specific 'type':
\begin{center}

\mysubsection{Character encoding: UTF-8}
\label{sec:utf8}
Character encoding is a major issue in computer systems, as different languages need a huge amount of different characters,
see the amusing blog of Joel Spolsky:\\
\exuUrl{https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/}{The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode ...}\\
More about encoding can be found in \exuUrl{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8}{Wikipedia:UTF-8}. UTF-8 encoding tables can be found within the wikipedia article and a comparison with the first 256 characters of unicode is provided at \exuUrl{https://www.utf8-chartable.de/}{UTF-8 char table}.

For short, \codeName\ uses UTF-8 character encoding in texts / strings drawn in OpenGL renderer window.
However, the set of available UTF-8 characters in \codeName\ is restricted to a very small set of characters (as compared to available characters in UTF-8), see the following table of available characters (using hex codes, e.g. \texttt{0x20} = \texttt{32}):
\begin{center}
  \footnotesize
  \begin{longtable}{| p{2cm} | p{4cm} | p{8cm} |}
