Currently, contributing is only possible by directly contacting the authors (e.g. writing an Issue or Discussion where you mention your requested change)
You can also write an email to reply.exudyn@gmail.com

Due to programming workflows and the very limited ressources for code review, the current repository is not fully open. 
However, it would be opened if sufficient requests exist.
